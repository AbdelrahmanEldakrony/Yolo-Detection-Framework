# Yolo-Detection-Framework
This Framework Allows Machine Learning Engineer to Train YOLO algorithm for Object Detection from scratch without using any external object detection framework,Retrain an existing model and Using an existing model to predict

Currently the Dataset Used is Pascal VOC(2012)
